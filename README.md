# Food Data App - 2021
### Authors: Alex Necakov, Kevin Lim

This project was developed in two weeks as a "mini-project" for my undergrad Senior Design course. The project is a mobile app developed in the Expo mobile development framework using primarily typescript. The app pulls nutrition data from the [FoodData Central API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html) via barcode scanning and posts that data to Firebase. My role on this project was to implement the barcode scanning and API hook-up functionality. Firebase work was done by my collaborator, Kevin Lim. This app can be deployed to mobile platforms using Expo.
